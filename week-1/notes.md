## Reading

- Evaluation combinations (1.1.3) - uses recursion. Visalizing this process is useful, tree accumulation (is this how CSS works?)
- Substution model (1.1.5)

## Lectures

- Managing complexity
- Levels of abstraction
    - Application
    - High level language
    - Low level language
    - Machine language
    - Logic gates
    - Transistors
    - Quantum Physics
- It's a lot easier to take a function that works and make it faster than take a function that is fast and make it work. Always optimise later.
- Normal vs Applicative order
- Functions must always return the same value given the same attribute
